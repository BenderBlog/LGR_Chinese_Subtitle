1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,270
Got a brioche bun here.

2
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,710
And get that toasted really quick.

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,010
Doesn't that look pleasant?

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,770
I want to keep it mostly soft but slightly crispy in the middle.

5
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,710
And on the bottom, I'm going to go with the base of this <i>Beer'n Brat Mustard</i>.

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,250
And of course, some duke's mayo on top.

7
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,680
Some romaine.

8
00:00:41,966 --> 00:00:43,630
Let's get it all crunched up.

9
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:54,270
A rather pleasant little tomato here from... a place that grows them.

10
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,720
Some ground black peppercorn.

11
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:08,090
Some ground pink Himalayan Salt.

12
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:11,333
Lovely little cucumber, heck yeah, cucumbers.

13
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,933
It's that time of year, I don't know, I'm in the mood~

14
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,390
Not looking for a whole bunch, just... yeah.

15
00:01:21,466 --> 00:01:24,540
Just a taste of it.

16
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,000
Going to go with a little spritz of basil, not much.

17
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:37,166
Man, I got some turkey, some Mesquite wood smoked.

18
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:52,033
And lastly, got some pepper jack cheese with little bits of jalapeno in there.

19
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:54,700
That'll do.

20
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:06,466
Ah man, this stuff melts beautifully.

21
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,700
There we go.

22
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:20,133
Haha, look at that, I know we don't need to cut it in half, but i feel like seeing it.

23
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:27,833
And there looks like taste. Mm~

24
00:02:32,366 --> 00:02:37,733
Yeah, for chips we got a dirty classic original recipe, sour cream and onion.

25
00:02:38,466 --> 00:02:42,233
Oh yeah, and smell that already.

26
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,333
And naturally we gotta give it for some pickles here.

27
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:51,100
Well, I'm going with some pickled okra.

28
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,933
Oh, these are big'ol okra pieces, good grief.

29
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,700
Yeah, just a couple of those will do.

30
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:05,433
I cannot stop eating these lately, this is gonna be good.

31
00:03:05,944 --> 00:03:10,140
[Applause]

32
00:03:11,466 --> 00:03:14,866
Oh man, I haven't eaten a sandwich in like a year.

33
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:19,266
Actually not true, [chuckle] but it has been a while, hasn't?

34
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:20,766
Let's try this thing.

35
00:03:23,433 --> 00:03:26,133
Mmm. Yeah. All right.

36
00:03:26,133 --> 00:03:32,866
Immediately that mesquite turkey is just going right through everything else,

37
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:35,600
coming out on top, even though it's in the middle.

38
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:43,566
Honestly, I could have gone for, maybe just a little more of the tomato. Just a little bit.

39
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:47,500
And then having that hint of cucumber, I don't know, not everyone likes cukes.

40
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,433
I rather enjoy them for a summery feel, in the... summer.

41
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:59,033
Actually, it's like another piece of cucumber. Slightly thicker (than) tomato.

42
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:03,433
That's about all that would change about this, because this is an awesome combo.

43
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,866
Yeah, right there.

44
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,400
That kind of just bite all the way through, magnificent.

45
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,033
Actually, made the exact same thing just with burger instead of turkey

46
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:19,233
for my own fourth of July things. And uh... yeah, it was awesome.

47
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,600
And I like cucumbers were pickles, but you know.

48
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,966
All right, chip time.

49
00:04:24,566 --> 00:04:26,766
Can't go wrong, sour cream and onion.

50
00:04:27,866 --> 00:04:30,700
I really like the, uh, <i>Dirty Chips</i>.

51
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,433
Contrary to the name, they're not actually terribly dirty.

52
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,933
And they're just, kind of lightly seasoned with

53
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,333
whatever it's supposed to taste like, sour cream and onion.

54
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,000
It's particularly light.

55
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,400
Okay, it's time for this...[laugh] ridiculous okra.

56
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,792
Why is he so long?

57
00:04:51,633 --> 00:04:55,400
Very mildly spicy. I guess I did pick up the... mildly spicy one,

58
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,840
But that's what it is. I like it.

59
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,920
And I know, obviously i still love pickles, but pickled everything?

60
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,744
I've just been doing pickled everything over the past.

61
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,672
I don't even know how long.

62
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,992
Yeah, if I can pickle it and it's a vegetable-like thing,

63
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:10,620
then i will probably eat it. Anyway... [chuckle]

64
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,152
Well, I hope you're hungry now, because I am.

65
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,496
See you in about a year.

66
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,816
I'm just kidding. I'll try to do more of these

67
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,016
Mmm~
