1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,290
Come on! That's right, suck it! Zombies!

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,330
This is the future guys. I'm telling 'ya.

3
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,050
Greeting and welcome to LGR Oddware.

4
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:23,260
Where we take a look at the hardware and software that is odd, forgoten and obsolete.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,640
And wow, today is all three, this is the Thrustmaster Wizzard Pinball Controller.

6
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:36,180
A set of an addon controller things to put on your PC keyboard,

7
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,340
to act pinball like a bumper controls.

8
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,610
As well as motion control for tilting the table.

9
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,800
I cannot wait to dive in this thing, this is a supreme oddware.

10
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,300
Is it going to be good.

11
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:53,090
So this right here is the Thrustmaster Wizzard Pinball Controller.

12
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,880
And yes, I recently got this, because uh...

13
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,420
Well, I've been looking for a long, if you could remember.

14
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,220
Way back when I did my video on the full Maxis collection of mine, I said this:

15
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,690
And with also, this version of it, which is the ...

16
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:12,140
Full Tilt! Pinball Wizzard Pinball Controller Edition by Thrustmaster.

17
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:16,010
This is just the CD they came packed in with the Wizzard Pinball Controller.

18
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,480
I don't have one of those...

19
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,560
Obviously that have changed

20
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,290
that I've been on look out for this ever since doing that video.

21
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,120
And when I finally got one, completely boxed and a good price,

22
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,920
this is just like the real thing, according to PC GAMER.

23
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,920
Oh, so cool.

24
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:36,380
It does come with the free version of a Full Tilt! Pinball, published by Maxis.

25
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,700
"Complete Retail Version At No Extra Cost!"

26
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,920
And yes, it is for Windows 3.x and Windows 95.

27
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:46,370
So we will be testing that out a little bit.

28
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,620
But yeah, let's just go ahead and take a look at the rest of this packaging,

29
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,680
where nothing is really cool.

30
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:54,280
Although, there is an another version of this that I think only came out in the UK.

31
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,370
They came packaged with a gamed called "Royal Flush".

32
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,260
And it had a box that look actually a bit like a pinball machine.

33
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,760
And that is even cooler than this.

34
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,000
So what the freak is this thing?

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,410
Well, this is made by Thrustmaster,

36
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,420
The same people that were responsible for doing

37
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,260
a whole ton of stuff, mainly joysticks.

38
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,910
Like the excellent F-16 flight stick.

39
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,090
This thing retailed for 39.95,

40
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:19,470
and uh, there's really not a whole lot else to talk about here,

41
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,540
just, uh, the fact that this is a box, it exists.

42
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,560
Oh yeah, there's some system requirement stuff there, but you know, pretty much...

43
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,680
You just need a computer that is IBM compactable and have a game port.

44
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,540
Because inside the box, you can see here, is actually plug into a

45
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,420
typically like a sound card, game port or whatever you have had a game port installed.

46
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,290
So you know, that attaches to a keyboard.

47
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,770
So these are the controllers themselves, um...

48
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:49,720
Pretty basic, very flimsy, plasticly kind of things, with crappy buttons.

49
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,380
They're really, really filmsy.

50
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:57,040
But anyway, this is kind of a cheap product, so I guess that make scene.

51
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,100
This sort of slide underneath your keyboard.

52
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,720
And it will typically come with a piece of Velcro?

53
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,960
To attach one side of the keyboard, in the other sides to

54
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,800
these keep from sliding around, because these do sliding around.

55
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:13,830
I just use something else, like typically, those 3M mounting strips.

56
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,430
We'll take a closer look at this in a monent,

57
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,920
but let's, uh, actually look inside the box here.

58
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,810
Because, well, you got, of cource, the software.

59
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:27,120
The configuration software and the Full Tilt! Pinball on this CD-ROM right here,

60
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,120
at least in this America version.

61
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,730
A quick start guide for the pinball controller, which is a...

62
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,610
Yeah, you pretty much just plug it in,

63
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:39,530
and then calibrate it like a joystick in the Windows 95.

64
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,690
And the... then there's a stuff for a... yeah, the Full Tilt! Pinball.

65
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:48,000
I would be curious to find out in the development, like, what made them do this?

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,250
I know there were a ton of pinball games back in the day.

67
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,800
Like, for example, there's another one that you can get with it.

68
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,000
This is by the people that made Crystal Caliburn, say pinball table.

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,580
Or uh, I think this is just a table.

70
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,190
Yeah, it comes with a CD-ROM called Loony Labyrinth.

71
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,240
There were so many PC pinball games back then. It was ridiculous.

72
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:10,760
So I guess it make scene that, you know, it would enough of a niche market to make this.

73
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,210
But, it still just so odd to me.

74
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:19,610
Inside, you also get the, the same quick guide or whatever, in a bunch of other languages.

75
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:24,840
A warranty card, some other warranty stuff.

76
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,610
And a Thrustmaster product catalog.

77
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,440
Yeah, here are the stuff they would made back in the day.

78
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,340
They did all sort of really strange little devices.

79
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,570
Mostly having to do with racing and flight, as you can see here.

80
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,170
But, this is another one that I actually want to get a hold of sometimes.

81
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,610
This is Pro Play Golf.

82
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:47,770
And it let you play a golf game with a actual kind of putter thing,

83
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:53,210
You will see a lot of different um, I don't know, place to have a virtual golf swing.

84
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:57,820
OK, I just give you a little bit more on the idea of what's going on here.

85
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,720
Just a closer shot. Isn't this lovely?

86
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:08,130
But yeah, here's the non-clicky kind of simulate a click, a kind of button.

87
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:13,360
Actually, when I take it apart, and then show you what actually goes on for the tilt control.

88
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:20,120
So inside here is actually a pretty straightforward as the button itself.

89
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,760
You can actually see the switch there, which...

90
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,440
You know, it's not the same kind of clicky metallic quality

91
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,820
that you could find in the arcade machine or really, pinball machine like micro switches.

92
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,900
I does a least click a little, it just feels really cheap.

93
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:44,720
And then these right here, you have these which control bumping and tilting.

94
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,180
You know, when you're moving around, or you bump in... either direction, really.

95
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,170
Then this little guy here will react,

96
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:56,360
and kind of finger out what you're doing as you move

97
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,380
and if you do too much, it till the table.

98
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:03,060
Which does did work, kind of similar to what real pinball table does.

99
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,370
Again, just much cheaper. And these are just really flimsy plasticky things.

100
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,320
And I feel like if I touch them too much,

101
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,680
they just going to explode, and give me shrapnel damage.

102
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,280
But yeah, let's go ahead and take a look at this things and action.

103
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,000
I guess I should put it back together first.

104
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,650
I know it's finally time to install these things,

105
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:27,900
to put it on the Packard Bell keyboard that I use lately 'cause nostalgia.

106
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:32,200
And yeah, this is literally a simple, a whole manage is.

107
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,200
You just slide under there, and there you go.

108
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,200
You also put it on the other side.

109
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:43,000
Like I said, it slides around. There's nothing that actually attach to anything.

110
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,860
So you really do need something in order to take care of that.

111
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:51,570
What I use actually, these little poster strips.

112
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:55,660
So, I can use anything obviously, Velcro will work too,

113
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,340
but these come off, without leaving sticky crappy residue.

114
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,160
And they keep these things in place. You just put on there.

115
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,320
That stick is on your keyboard. And that's pinball like, I suppose.

116
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,760
Doesn't feel anything like the actual click of a real pinball table.

117
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,500
But that's OK! We're gonna try it anyway!

118
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:19,570
And as you can see here hopefully, in the control panel of the gaming option

119
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:25,800
for Windows 95 or 98, in this case, you select it as a regular 2-axis, 4-button joystick.

120
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:32,720
And yeah, you can test it out and, try the motion, axes things there.

121
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,690
So that's cool.

122
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:36,240
And there's actually two different functions for each buttons.

123
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,010
Like, you press it halfway, it'll press one button.

124
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:43,700
And press it all the way it get two, er, there are two buttons for the button.

125
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,020
I guess that's for like doing things like, uh, swings, hits and whatnot.

126
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:54,280
And of course, you also got the Thrustmaster Wizzard configuration things here

127
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,560
which, you don't actually need to use.

128
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,570
Useless you're using a game or playing a game that

129
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:04,600
doesn't necessarily support this thing out of box.

130
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:09,920
Full Tilt! Pinball does. But if you have other game like come with preconfigured stuff

131
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:15,020
like 3DO Ultra Pinball, Crystal Caliburn... whatever, I really don't know what was it.

132
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,000
Full Tilt! Pinball, for some reason...

133
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Basically this is a keyboard interpreter for the thing.

134
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,880
So if you wanted to, you could actually map this stuff to keyboard commands

135
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,650
in order to make it work with stuff that doesn't made for the joystick.

136
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:38,070
So let's go ahead and try Full Tilt! Pinball here. Because that's what it comes with.

137
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:40,890
Let's do Space Cadet, as well as the Skulduggery

138
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,000
and the Dragon's Keep. But we'll try Space Cadet.

139
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,910
And yes, there are two other tables that goes along Space Cadet.

140
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:49,580
Did you know that?  I did!  'Cause Maxis.

141
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,790
Alright, so what we're doing here is go to enable joystick.

142
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,440
And when I first tried this, it didn't work,

143
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,010
because it actually has to be given the ID of one.

144
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:04,140
The Thrustmaster Wizzard program won't work either unless the joystick is mapped...

145
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:09,360
to ID 1, if it's like ID 2 or 3 or something, it's not gonna work. So just make sure that is that.

146
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,030
Yeah, this looks pretty good.

147
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,240
Pinball Wizzard Controller.

148
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:24,120
It might worked, that thing is sensitive as far as the tilt controls.

149
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,120
It's like it's bumping the table at all time.

150
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,120
It's not even touching anything.

151
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,020
That table is like an earthquake!

152
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:40,330
I will say though, that the buttons are themselves were surprisingly better than

153
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,860
you might imagine feeling how flimsy they are, just on their own.

154
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,860
But I mean it, you know...

155
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,720
Oh man, It's like playing pinball, it's pretty cool.

156
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:56,640
Somehow I think I turned down the sound effects, I don't entirely sure how that happens.

157
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,440
My word, I suck at this even more.

158
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,020
So here is what I am talking about this far is like,

159
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:08,070
I'm not touching anything and the table is bumping.

160
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,740
I don't know how well that showing up.

161
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,580
But yeah, if I tilt it,

162
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,380
I mean, it really does work. At least it kinda works.

163
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:21,890
The problem being... I mean, the bumping is really good.

164
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,210
That's neat.

165
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,920
But it does tilt, you know, pretty easily, so...

166
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,560
OK, gonna try with one more game here. This is Balls of Steel.

167
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,940
And it actually mapped to the keyboard control and doesn't support,

168
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,820
like joystick or... whatever.

169
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,410
This is... So, let's try this out.

170
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,980
And it do crap.

171
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,310
That's great.

172
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:56,010
OK. So obviously the thing is working.

173
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,010
Like it's mapped to the keyboard.

174
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,120
I guess that's typing thing.

175
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,680
That's typing things, so that's fine.

176
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,800
But when I gonna play it.

177
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,250
And it's mapped to the proper controls and everything.

178
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,940
It's a different story.

179
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,970
Nothing happens.

180
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,020
I don't even know why.

181
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,820
So uh, that kinda sucks.

182
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:30,660
I was totally given up, but that's kind of a, uh, I even don't know what I am doing.

183
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,740
So, let's try this.

184
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,940
It should be fun.

185
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,690
Well, that turns.

186
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,300
Uh, that moves forward.

187
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,720
That shoots.

188
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:49,520
And see, turing... I can totally do this!

189
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,620
They're shooting each other!

190
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,970
Come on! That's right, suck it! Zombies!

191
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,140
This is the future guys. I'm telling 'ya.

192
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,770
Gonna turn left, since the right doesn't work.

193
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,220
GO FORWARD!

194
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,390
Oh, this is way better than pinball.

195
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,770
Oh crap, what shoots?

196
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:33,370
I forgot.

197
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,000
I think that does, sort of.

198
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,290
That's right!

199
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,610
I wanna beat this level!

200
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,820
Oh, it can be the greatest things.

201
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,720
And I think I can just run through it.

202
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,000
Oh man.

203
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,370
Here we go. Oh, I almost had it for a second.

204
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,510
This is got to be what this actually made for.

205
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,940
Don't let the Imp see me!

206
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:12,370
He's in the corner! Oh, how do I open things?

207
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:16,610
Here it is!

208
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,810
Yeah!

209
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:31,000
Thrustmaster Wizzard Pinball Controller, ten star out of five!

210
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Thank you for watching LGR Oddware.
